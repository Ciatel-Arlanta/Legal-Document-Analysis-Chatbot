# Legal Document Analysis Chatbot

This project is a Streamlit-based chatbot for analyzing legal documents such as contracts, NDAs, leases, and wills. It extracts text (even from scanned PDFs using OCR), splits it into meaningful chunks, embeds it using a legal-domain embedding model, and uses a language model to answer user questions in context.

## Features

- Upload legal documents in PDF format
- Text extraction with fallback OCR for scanned PDFs
- Clause detection (e.g., termination, confidentiality, indemnity)
- Retrieval-based question answering using HuggingFace's Flan-T5
- Embedding with InLegalBERT (fallback to MiniLM if unavailable)
- Suggested legal FAQs generated from document summaries
- Context-aware conversational memory
- GPU acceleration support (PyTorch CUDA)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PyTorch
- PyMuPDF (`fitz`)
- Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`)
- HuggingFace Embeddings
- Chroma / Custom Vector Store

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-chatbot.git
cd legal-chatbot
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## How to run streamlit application on Google Colab

Start by installing Streamlit in your Colab environment.

```bash
! pip install streamlit -q
```

Retrieve your external IP address using the wget command

```bash
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
```
The `%%writefile app.py` writes the streamlit app code as a app.py file into the working space of colab.

```python
%%writefile app.py

#Streamlit code
print("Hello")
```

Install local tunnel to host the streamlit app
```bash
!npm install localtunnel
```

Run the streamlit app
```bash
!streamlit run /content/app.py &>/content/logs.txt &
```

As the streamlit app needs the port 8501 we will open that port using localtunnel
```bash
!npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser.
2. Upload a legal PDF document (contract, NDA, lease, etc.).
3. The system will:
   - Extract text using PDF parser or OCR (if scanned)
   - Embed the content using a legal-domain embedding model
   - Store it in a vector store
   - Allow you to ask legal questions about the content
4. View generated answers and the document references used.

## Example Questions

- What are the confidentiality obligations?
- Are there termination clauses?
- What are the payment terms?
- What is the governing law mentioned in this agreement?
